# Embedded Systems Engineering Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to assist beginners aspiring to build a career as an Embedded Engineer / Developer. To provide comprehensive guidance, the topics have been carefully selected based on current job requirements and organized according to my personal experience.

Becoming an embedded engineer requires a broad understanding of both software and hardware. If you are starting on this journey, you must be highly motivated and passionate to pursue this path. The field of embedded systems demands a solid understanding of hardware functionality. But, as the well-known saying goes, "Hardware is hard!". So, patience and passion are the essential qualities that will help you overcome the various challenges encountered along this journey.

## What is an Embedded System?

[ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765 Standard:](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec-ieee:24765:ed-2:v1:en)

> **computer system** that is **part of a larger system** and **performs some of the requirements of that system**. For example, a computer system
used in an aircraft or rapid transit system.
>
> The hardware and software of an embedded system are usually **minimized** and **optimized** for **specific functions**. The embedded system includes at least one microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor. The embedded system designed to optimize reliability, cost, size and power saving for applications.

["Making Embedded Systems" Book:](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-embedded-systems/9781449308889/)

> An embedded system is a **computerized system** that is **purpose built for its application**.

["Computer Organization and Embedded Systems" Book:](https://a.co/d/2lt4Svf)

> A **physical system** that employs **computer control** for a **specific purpose**, rather than for general-purpose computation, is referred to as an embedded system.

[Analog Devices Glossary:](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/glossary/embedded-system.html)

> An embedded system is a system in which the **computer** (generally a microcontroller or microprocessor) is included **as an integral part of the system**.
>
> Often, the computer is **relatively invisible to the user**, without obvious applications, files, or operating systems. Examples of products with invisible embedded systems are the controller that runs a microwave oven or the engine control system of a modern automobile.

[Embedded Systems Glossary:](https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/glossary-e)

> A combination of **computer hardware and software**, and perhaps **additional mechanical or other parts**, designed to perform a **dedicated function**.
>
> In some cases, embedded systems are **part of a larger system** or product, as in the case of an antilock braking system in a car.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is divided into three main sections: **SOFTWARE**, **HARDWARE**, and **SOFT SKILLS**.

The hardware and software sections overlap in many embedded job roles. Different job titles, such as "Embedded Software Engineer / Developer," "Firmware Engineer / Developer," and "Embedded Linux Software Engineer / Developer," tend to focus more on software. On the other hand, job roles like "Embedded Hardware Engineer" and "Hardware Design Engineer" primarily focus on hardware. Additionally, there are positions like "Embedded Systems Engineer" that require a good understanding of both hardware and software. It's crucial to understand that each company in the embedded industry may have specific requirements for a job role, regardless of its title.

With this in mind, the roadmap is designed to cover topics necessary for an "Embedded Systems Engineer" role. If you are aiming for an embedded software position, you should focus more on software skills in the roadmap. Conversely, if you are interested in an embedded hardware job, you should prioritize hardware skills.

In the embedded industry, all job roles require some soft skills, which cannot be acquired solely through reading or watching videos. Soft skills are developed through communication with others and facing various work challenges. Improving soft skills is not a one-size-fits-all approach. It varies depending on your individual characteristics and involves being aware of your own strengths and weaknesses. Enhancing these skills takes time and effort.

**Remember that the emphasis on software or hardware skills may vary depending on the specific requirements of the company or job position.**

##### PlatformIO

PlatformIO is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products.

- [PlatformIO - A professional collaborative platform for embedded development](https://platformio.org/)

PlatformIO is not yet extensively adopted in industrial and large-scale projects, however, it is an excellent choice for individuals working on smaller projects. This is because it greatly reduces the need to install frameworks and setup build and debug tools, allowing you to concentrate on programming.

#### 🕹️ Arduino

If you do not have any background in programming the embedded systems, Arduino boards and libraries are the best choice for you to start and learn the basics. Just keep in mind that most of the Arduino libraries are developed for learning purposes and are not optimized to be used in industry.

Additionally, the [Arduino Core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API) takes care of most of the low-level operations and manipulation of registers that you, as an embedded engineer, should be able to handle yourself. If you want to become a professional embedded developer, you must be able to effectively use industry-standard APIs and frameworks provided and approved by microcontroller vendors. For example, CMSIS for ARM Cortex, STM32Cube for STM32, ESP-IDF for Espressif microcontrollers, etc.

## History

The idea of creating this roadmap came from [vazeri / Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018](https://github.com/vazeri/Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018) which was well designed but had some flaws and not updated for years.
I took that idea, changed the structure of the roadmap and tried to improve it. The initial results can be accessed in [m3y54m / Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived) which is now archived. Early versions of the roadmap were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com) which is not suitable for these types of diagrams. So I decided to use Microsoft Visio instead and redrew the whole diagram.
