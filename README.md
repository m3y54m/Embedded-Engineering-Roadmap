## 🗺️ The Roadmap

![Embedded Systems Engineering Roadmap](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap/releases/latest/download/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap.png)

The embedded systems engineering roadmap is structured into three fundamental areas: **SOFTWARE**, **HARDWARE**, and **SOFT SKILLS**.

While the intersection of hardware and software is prevalent in embedded systems, specific job titles tend to emphasize one aspect over the other. For instance, roles like "Embedded Software Engineer/Developer," "Firmware Engineer/Developer," and "Embedded Linux Engineer/Developer" predominantly focus on software development. In contrast, positions such as "Embedded Hardware Engineer" and "Hardware Design Engineer" primarily deal with hardware design and electronics. Moreover, there are roles like "Embedded Systems Engineer" that necessitate a comprehensive understanding of both hardware and software.

It's crucial to note that each company in the embedded industry may have unique requirements for a given job title. Therefore, it's essential to tailor your focus based on your career aspirations. If you're seeking an embedded software position, prioritize the software-related skills outlined in the roadmap. Conversely, if you're interested in an embedded hardware job, concentrate on hardware skills and dedicate more time to learning electronics.

The roadmap provides a comprehensive guide to the essential topics for a typical "Embedded Systems Engineer" role. By delving into both software and hardware aspects, you can develop the necessary skills to thrive in this dynamic field. However, if you have a clear preference for software or hardware, you can tailor your learning path accordingly.

### ✳️ FPGA Development

FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) are specialized integrated circuits that can be configured to perform various digital logic functions. They are widely used in embedded systems to achieve high performance, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. FPGA designers use hardware description languages (HDLs) to create customized circuits that map directly to the FPGA architecture. Since FPGA engineering and verification differ significantly from embedded software development, it stands as a specialized domain within embedded systems.

### ✳️ Sensors & Actuators

Sensors and actuators are the eyes and hands of embedded systems. They are responsible for gathering information about the environment and taking actions based on that information. Sensors convert physical phenomena, such as temperature, light, or sound, into electrical signals that can be processed by the embedded system. Actuators, on the other hand, convert electrical signals into physical actions, such as controlling the speed of a motor or opening and closing a valve.

### ✳️ Operating Systems

Embedded systems can be programmed with either an operating system (OS) or directly on the hardware, known as bare-metal programming. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. Embedded operating systems provide a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the application code, offering benefits like resource management, task scheduling, error handling, and communication capabilities. However, they add overhead and may not be suitable for memory-constrained applications.

#### 🔵 Real-Time Operating Systems

Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are specialized operating systems designed to meet strict timing deadlines. They are used in embedded systems where timing is critical, such as avionics, robotics, and medical devices. RTOSs provide a deterministic environment in which tasks can be executed with predictable timing. This ensures that critical tasks are always executed on time, even in the presence of interrupts and other disruptions.

### ✳️ Embedded Security

Security in embedded systems is particularly challenging due to resource constraints and the inherent nature of these devices. Embedded systems typically operate on small, low-power microcontrollers with limited memory and processing power. This makes it difficult to implement the same level of security as traditional computing platforms. Additionally, embedded systems often have limited access to updates and patches, making them more vulnerable to known vulnerabilities.

### ✳️ Appendix-A: Advanced Topics

#### 🔵 Discrete Mathematics

A common subject that is essential to Computer Science students and some Math/Electrical Engineering Majors based on the [Assoication For Computing Machinery Guidelines for CS/CE education](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations). It houses the most essential subjects for _abstract mathematical modelling_ and _theory of computation_. Furthermore, it helps students to establish the essential engineering mindset that represents the common basis among all computer science and computer engineering domains. However, Logic, Theory of combinatorics, Coding Theory, and Theory of Computation are among the most essential subjects for Embedded Systems Engineers.

_**Goal of learning Discrete Mathematics:**_ Embedded Systems Engineers should be able to grasp most of these information sooner or later based on their subspeciality; as it explains the scientific and theoretical basis of computer engineering (e.g., Coding Theory for Audio/Video Encoding/Decoding and Data Transmission - Automata Theory for event control and data transmission - Logic for digital circuit design and switching algebra - $$\Pi$$ Calculus and Automata Theory for Concurrency Modelling).

_Discrete Mathematics_ is a multi-semester course that involves subjects about the theoretical mathematical basis of computer science, including but not limited to:

- Logic (Propositional, Quantificational and Normal Forms).
- Axiomatic Set Theory (Sets, Operations on sets, and Power Sets).
- Relation Sets and Function Theory (i.e., $$\lambda$$ Calculus).
- Theory of combinatorics.
- Matrix and Graph Theory.
- Theory of computation (i.e., Computational Automata Theory, Computational Complexity, and Computational Computability).
- Automata Theory (e.g., Finite-state Machines, Pushdown Automata, Turing Machines, and Cellular Automata).
- Process Modelling/Calculi (i.e., $$\pi$$ Calculus).
- Coding Theory.
- Division Theorem Modular Arithmetics (Parts of Number Theory).

## History

At first this was meant to be my personal reading list but as the list gradually became bigger and bigger, I wondered why not share it with others. So I did research on current job postings for embedded engineering roles, selecting the most frequent skills and including them on a roadmap. In order to make the roadmap more comprehensive I also added some basic skills and finally came up with what you see here.

The idea of creating this roadmap came from [vazeri / Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018](https://github.com/vazeri/Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018) which was well designed but had some flaws and not updated for years. I took that idea, changed the structure of the roadmap and tried to improve it. The initial results can be accessed in [m3y54m / Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived) which is now archived. Early versions of the roadmap were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com) which is not suitable for these types of diagrams. So I decided to use Microsoft Visio instead and redrew the whole diagram.
