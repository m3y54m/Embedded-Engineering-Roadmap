## 🗺️ The Roadmap

![Embedded Systems Engineering Roadmap](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap/releases/latest/download/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap.png)

The embedded systems engineering roadmap is structured into three fundamental areas: **SOFTWARE**, **HARDWARE**, and **SOFT SKILLS**.

While the intersection of hardware and software is prevalent in embedded systems, specific job titles tend to emphasize one aspect over the other. For instance, roles like "Embedded Software Engineer/Developer," "Firmware Engineer/Developer," and "Embedded Linux Engineer/Developer" predominantly focus on software development. In contrast, positions such as "Embedded Hardware Engineer" and "Hardware Design Engineer" primarily deal with hardware design and electronics. Moreover, there are roles like "Embedded Systems Engineer" that necessitate a comprehensive understanding of both hardware and software.

It's crucial to note that each company in the embedded industry may have unique requirements for a given job title. Therefore, it's essential to tailor your focus based on your career aspirations. If you're seeking an embedded software position, prioritize the software-related skills outlined in the roadmap. Conversely, if you're interested in an embedded hardware job, concentrate on hardware skills and dedicate more time to learning electronics.

The roadmap provides a comprehensive guide to the essential topics for a typical "Embedded Systems Engineer" role. By delving into both software and hardware aspects, you can develop the necessary skills to thrive in this dynamic field. However, if you have a clear preference for software or hardware, you can tailor your learning path accordingly.

> [!NOTE] 
> **Remember that the importance of individual software and hardware skills can differ depending on the specific requirements of the company and the job role.**

## 😕 Don't Know Where to Start!

If you feel overwhelmed by the extensive list of topics in the roadmap, you're not alone. Before delving too deeply, let's ease into it with some simple starter projects. Learning embedded systems engineering takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't understand something right away. Keep practicing and you will eventually get there.

### ⚒️ Projects

Engaging in hands-on projects is the most effective approach to learning. Rather than solely relying on theoretical knowledge from books or articles, undertaking projects allows for practical learning experiences. Even a seemingly basic project has the potential to teach you more than aimless reading. You can refer to books, articles, and courses when faced with difficulties in understanding the problems in a real-world project.

Don't try to build a complex project right away. Start with small, manageable projects to get your feet wet.

### ✳️ Sensors & Actuators

Sensors and actuators are the eyes and hands of embedded systems. They are responsible for gathering information about the environment and taking actions based on that information. Sensors convert physical phenomena, such as temperature, light, or sound, into electrical signals that can be processed by the embedded system. Actuators, on the other hand, convert electrical signals into physical actions, such as controlling the speed of a motor or opening and closing a valve.

### ✳️ Operating Systems

Embedded systems can be programmed with either an operating system (OS) or directly on the hardware, known as bare-metal programming. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. Embedded operating systems provide a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the application code, offering benefits like resource management, task scheduling, error handling, and communication capabilities. However, they add overhead and may not be suitable for memory-constrained applications.

#### 🔵 Real-Time Operating Systems

Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are specialized operating systems designed to meet strict timing deadlines. They are used in embedded systems where timing is critical, such as avionics, robotics, and medical devices. RTOSs provide a deterministic environment in which tasks can be executed with predictable timing. This ensures that critical tasks are always executed on time, even in the presence of interrupts and other disruptions.

### ✳️ GUI Design

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have become an indispensable part of modern embedded systems, offering a user-friendly and intuitive way to interact with devices. Designing effective GUIs for embedded systems requires careful consideration of factors such as resource constraints, user experience, and real-time performance.

## History

At first this was meant to be my personal reading list but as the list gradually became bigger and bigger, I wondered why not share it with others. So I did research on current job postings for embedded engineering roles, selecting the most frequent skills and including them on a roadmap. In order to make the roadmap more comprehensive I also added some basic skills and finally came up with what you see here.

The idea of creating this roadmap came from [vazeri / Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018](https://github.com/vazeri/Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018) which was well designed but had some flaws and not updated for years. I took that idea, changed the structure of the roadmap and tried to improve it. The initial results can be accessed in [m3y54m / Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived) which is now archived. Early versions of the roadmap were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com) which is not suitable for these types of diagrams. So I decided to use Microsoft Visio instead and redrew the whole diagram.
