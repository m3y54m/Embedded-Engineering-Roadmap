This roadmap is designed to help beginners aspiring to build a career as an **Embedded Engineer/Developer**, as well as assist current practitioners in expanding their skills. 

You should know that becoming an embedded engineer requires a broad understanding of both software and hardware. If you really want to pursue this career you must be highly motivated and passionate about it. As well as programming and software development skills, embedded systems demand a solid understanding of hardware functionality. However, as the well-known saying goes, "Hardware is hard!". So if you still know nothing about embedded systems, a hard yet exciting journey awaits you. But don't panic and be patient for the challenges you may encounter along this journey. By dedicating enough time and effort practicing and doing projects you will soon find yourself as a real embedded engineer! 😀

## ❓ What is an Embedded System?

[ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765 Standard:](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec-ieee:24765:ed-2:v1:en)

> **computer system** that is **part of a larger system** and **performs some of the requirements of that system**. For example, a computer system
used in an aircraft or rapid transit system.
>
> The hardware and software of an embedded system are usually **minimized** and **optimized** for **specific functions**. The embedded system includes at least one microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor. The embedded system designed to optimize reliability, cost, size and power saving for applications.

["Making Embedded Systems" Book:](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-embedded-systems/9781449308889/)

> An embedded system is a **computerized system** that is **purpose built for its application**.

["Computer Organization and Embedded Systems" Book:](https://a.co/d/2lt4Svf)

> A **physical system** that employs **computer control** for a **specific purpose**, rather than for general-purpose computation, is referred to as an embedded system.

[Analog Devices Glossary:](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/glossary/embedded-system.html)

> An embedded system is a system in which the **computer** (generally a microcontroller or microprocessor) is included **as an integral part of the system**.
>
> Often, the computer is **relatively invisible to the user**, without obvious applications, files, or operating systems. Examples of products with invisible embedded systems are the controller that runs a microwave oven or the engine control system of a modern automobile.

[Embedded Systems Glossary:](https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/glossary-e)

> A combination of **computer hardware and software**, and perhaps **additional mechanical or other parts**, designed to perform a **dedicated function**.
>
> In some cases, embedded systems are **part of a larger system** or product, as in the case of an antilock braking system in a car.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap

The roadmap is divided into three main sections: **SOFTWARE**, **HARDWARE**, and **SOFT SKILLS**.

The hardware and software sections overlap in many embedded job roles. Different job titles, such as "Embedded Software Engineer/Developer," "Firmware Engineer/Developer," and "Embedded Linux Engineer/Developer," tend to focus more on software. On the other hand, job roles like "Embedded Hardware Engineer" and "Hardware Design Engineer" primarily focus on hardware. Additionally, there are positions like "Embedded Systems Engineer" that require a good understanding of both hardware and software. It's importnat to understand that each company in the embedded industry may have specific requirements for a job role, regardless of its title.

With this in mind, the roadmap is designed to cover topics necessary for a typical "Embedded Systems Engineer" role. If you are aiming for an embedded software position, you should focus more on software skills in the roadmap. Conversely, if you are interested in an embedded hardware job, you should prioritize hardware skills and put more time on learning electronics.

Just like many other job roles, an embedded engineer requires some soft skills that cannot be acquired solely through reading or watching videos. Soft skills are developed through communication with people and facing various work challenges. Improving soft skills is not a one-size-fits-all approach. It will vary based on one's individual traits and requires self-awareness of your strengths and areas for growth. Enhancing these skills takes time and effort.

> [!NOTE] 
> **Remember that the importance of individual software and hardware skills can differ depending on the specific requirements of the company and the job role.**

## 😕 Don't Know Where to Start!

If you feel overwhelmed by the extensive list of topics in the roadmap, you're not alone. Before delving too deeply, let's ease into it with some simple starter projects. Learning embedded systems engineering takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't understand something right away. Keep practicing and you will eventually get there.

### ⚒️ Projects

Engaging in hands-on projects is the most effective approach to learning. Rather than solely relying on theoretical knowledge from books or articles, undertaking projects allows for practical learning experiences. Even a seemingly basic project has the potential to teach you more than aimless reading. You can refer to books, articles, and courses when faced with difficulties in understanding the problems in a real-world project.

Don't try to build a complex project right away. Start with small, manageable projects to get your feet wet.

### 🕹️ Arduino

If you do not have any background in programming the embedded systems, Arduino boards and libraries are the best choice for you to start and learn the basics. Just keep in mind that most of the Arduino libraries are developed for learning purposes and are not optimized to be used in industry.

Additionally, the [Arduino Core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API) takes care of most of the low-level operations and manipulation of registers that you, as an embedded engineer, should be able to handle yourself. If you want to become a professional embedded developer, you should be able to effectively use industry-standard APIs and SDKs provided and approved by microcontroller vendors. For example, CMSIS for ARM Cortex, STM32Cube for STM32, ESP-IDF for Espressif microcontrollers, etc.

### ✳️ Microcontrollers

Microcontrollers are integrated circuits (ICs) that combine a microprocessor, memory, and input/output (I/O) peripherals on a single chip. They are designed for embedded applications, where they are used to control devices in a variety of industries, including automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and healthcare.

Some popular microcontroller families include AVR, PIC, STM32, MSP430, nRF, and ESP32. Choosing the right microcontroller involves assessing application requirements, processing power, memory needs, and input/output capabilities. Consider ease of use, cost, reliability, availability, and future expansion.

## History

At first this was meant to be my personal reading list but as the list gradually became bigger and bigger, I wondered why not share it with others. So I did research on current job postings for embedded engineering roles, selecting the most frequent skills and including them on a roadmap. In order to make the roadmap more comprehensive I also added some basic skills and finally came up with what you see here.

The idea of creating this roadmap came from [vazeri / Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018](https://github.com/vazeri/Embedded-Engineering-RoadMap-2018) which was well designed but had some flaws and not updated for years. I took that idea, changed the structure of the roadmap and tried to improve it. The initial results can be accessed in [m3y54m / Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap-Archived) which is now archived. Early versions of the roadmap were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com) which is not suitable for these types of diagrams. So I decided to use Microsoft Visio instead and redrew the whole diagram.
